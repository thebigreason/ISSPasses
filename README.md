# ISS Passes

## A web app for tracking upcoming passes of the International Space Station.

Heavens-Above.com is cool, but a little unwieldily to use, especially on a mobile phone. This a little web app I whipped up that uses the [Unofficial Heavens Above API](http://uhaapi.com/) to retrive upcoming pass information for the ISS based on my latitude and longitude.

I’m hosting this at [iss.thebigreason.com](iss.thebigreason.com). It’s currently hard-coded to use my geo location, but I plan to add HTML5 geo location in the near future.
